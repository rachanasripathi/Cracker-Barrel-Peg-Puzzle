How to play the Peg Game

Place a peg in each of the holes of the game board. You’ll have one place on the board that won’t have a peg.

Jump one peg over another to an open space and remove the one that was jumped. Keep doing this until only a single peg remains.

If you are successful and leave only one peg, you are a “genius.”

Leave two pegs, and you’re “pretty smart.”

Leave three pegs, and you are just plain “dumb.”

But leave four pegs, and sorry, but you are an “EQ-NO-RA-MOOOSE.” (it’s all in good fun – no judgement here!).
